My most riveting adventure with my duckie was (sort of binge) watching numerous episodes of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey during winter break. 
It was very enjoyable to relax and forget about school, and listen to the calming words of Neil deGrasse Tyson as he talked about some of the most fascinating things about our world.
